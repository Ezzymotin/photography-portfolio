#  Captured Moments - Photography Portfolio

This is a personal photography portfolio site built to showcase my favorite photographs and express my passion for capturing beautiful moments through the lens. The project was created as part of a web development assignment with a strong focus on semantic HTML, CSS styling, and deploying through GitHub Pages.
